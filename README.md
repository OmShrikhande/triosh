 Welcome to the Expo App 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project, initiated by **Om Shrikhande**, created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app). It provides a seamless foundation for building cross-platform applications using React Native.

🚀 Get Started

To start building your app, follow these simple steps:

1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

 2. Start the App

You can run the app on your desired platform by using the command below:

```bash
npm run start
```

You’ll have the option to open the app in:

- A [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- An [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- An [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a sandbox for rapid development

 🛠️ Developing Your App

You can start developing right away by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses a [file-based routing system](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction), making navigation easier to manage.

 Project Directory Structure

```plaintext
📂 expo-app/
 ┣ 📂 app/        Your app's components and screens
 ┣ 📂 app-example/   Example code, reset when running the reset-project command
 ┣ 📂 assets/     Images, fonts, etc.
 ┗ 📄 app.json    Project configuration file
```

 Reset the Project

When you're ready to start fresh, move the starter code and initialize a blank slate by running:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This will move the starter code into the **app-example** directory and create a new, empty **app** directory for custom development.
